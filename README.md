# OS-Project-Dining-Philospher

The Dining Philosophers problem is a classic synchronization problem in computer science that illustrates challenges with concurrency and resource allocation. The problem is described as a group of philosophers who sit at a circular table, and in front of each philosopher is a plate of spaghetti and a fork. The philosophers spend their time alternating between thinking and eating, but they require two forks to eat. The challenge is to prevent deadlock and starvation while allowing each philosopher to eat.
